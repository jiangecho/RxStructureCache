# RxStructureCache
A RxCache for structure data.

##Why
1. I need to cache some structure data, such as tweets, rank list and so on.
2. I need some feature like this: firstly load data from cache, then continue to load data from server.

##Todo
1. Test it in production enviroment.
2. Support non-structure data?

##Libraries
[GreenDAO](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO)

##Thanks
[RxCache](https://github.com/VictorAlbertos/RxCache), I like it, but I think it's lack of some features I need.
